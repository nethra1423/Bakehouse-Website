        <div class="about-col">
            <h3>What we Serve</h3>
            <p>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.During the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States.[8] One company patented a cake-bread mix to deal with this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, cake, as it is known today, became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-col">
            <h3>What we Use</h3>
            <p>The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream or syrups),[1] iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

                <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>

                    <h1 align="center">CHESSY PIZZAS</h1>
                    <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.The Ligurian pizza resembles the pissaladière of Provence in France, adding anchovies to olives and onions. Pizza has also spread from Italy throughout much of the rest of the world, and, in regions outside of Italy, the toppings used vary with the ingredients available and the flavour profile preferred</p>

            <h1 align="center">OVERLOADED BURGERS</h1>
            <p>The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger. In Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, a piece of chicken breast on a bun is known as a chicken burger, which would generally not be considered to be a burger in the United States; Americans would generally call it a chicken sandwich, but in Australian English and New Zealand English a sandwich requires sliced bread (not a bun), so it would not be considered a sandwich.[2][3]

              Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants. There are many international and regional variations of hamburger.</p>

            <h1 align="center">MOCKTAILS</h1>
            <p>Fire up the blender and create a virgin Piña Colada! This made-from-scratch recipe uses just three ingredients: pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and ice. It's a fabulous tropical smoothie with a taste that outshines any nonalcoholic Piña Colada mix you can buy at the store.
              Non-Alcoholic Mojito
              Virgin Mojito
              The Spruce / Rachel Riesgraf
              Enjoy the refreshing taste of a mojito without the rum. The virgin mojito recipe is a quick and simple drink made with fresh lime juice and mint leaves. It's sweetened with honey syrup and topped with club soda and is a fantastic family-friendly drink for summer barbecues.
              Virgin Mary
              The Virgin Mary: Spice Up Brunch With a Great Tomato Drink
              The Spruce / Madhumita Sathishkumar
              Start your morning off right with a freshly prepared virgin mary. It has all the spice that makes the bloody mary great, but there's no vodka. Use fresh tomato juice if you like, or pick up a bottled version and have fun customizing the recipe to suit your taste. You can also keep a pitcher in the fridge for a quick drink.
              Citrus Fizz
              Citrus Fizz
              The Spruce / Julia Hartbeck
              Eggs add texture and flavor to drinks and are commonly used in fizz cocktails. They don't make many appearances in mocktails, so this citrus fizz is a delightful surprise. The base is a tempting mix of orange, lemon, and lime sweetened with grenadine. It's shaken, then strained over ice, and topped with sparkling water. The taste is fascinating, and it's a recipe you'll definitely want to experience
              Sweet Sunrise
              Sweet sunrise mocktail with an orange slice
              The Spruce / Nyssa Tanner
              The sweet sunrise is an excellent breakfast, brunch, or afternoon drink that skips the liquor of a very popular cocktail. Also called the virgin sunrise, it is nothing more than a tequila sunrise; hold the tequila. Grenadine adds a great contrast to fresh-squeezed orange juice and gives it the ideal amount of sweetness.
